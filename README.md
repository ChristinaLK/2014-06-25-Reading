University of Reading Workshop, June 2014

## Lesson Plan

### Lesson 1: Unix Shell Scripting

Introduction to command-line

### Lesson 2: Python

Introduction to Python programming


### Lesson 3: Version Control with git/GitHub

Students will work in pairs and in each pair one student will make a GitHub repo, then give the other student commit access on that repo. Students will take turns making modifications to learn various bits of git functionality.


### Lesson 4: Testing Your Software - Unit Testing

Continuing to work in pairs, students will use test driven development to construct a small scientific program in the IPython Notebook and then take their work to .py files to see how nose works from the command line.
