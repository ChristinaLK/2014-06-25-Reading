## Lesson Plan

### Lesson 1: Unix Shell Scripting

Students will be introduced to shell, command-line interface and it's importance in Scientific computing for task automation.

### Lesson 2: Python

Students will be taught basic programming constructs in Python on how to perform data manipulation/ analysis. 


### Lesson 3: Version Control with git/GitHub

Students will work in pairs and in each pair one student will make a GitHub repo, then give the other student commit access on that repo. Students will take turns making modifications to learn various bits of git functionality.


### Lesson 4: Testing Your Software - Unit Testing

Continuing to work in pairs, students will use test driven development to construct a small scientific program in the IPython Notebook and then take their work to .py files to see how nose works from the command line.
