Itâ€™s funny, they named
Mars after the God of War
Have a look at Earth.

Thirty-six million
miles of whispering welcome.
Mars, you called us home.

Stars in the blue sky
cheerfully observe the Earth
while we long for them.

Distant red planet
the dreams of earth beings flow
we will someday roam.

Mars, your secret is
unknown for humanity
we want to know you.

The Tao that is seen
Is not the true Tao, until
You bring fresh toner.

With searching comes loss
and the presence of absence:
"My Thesis" not found.

Yesterday it worked
Today it is not working
Software is like that.
